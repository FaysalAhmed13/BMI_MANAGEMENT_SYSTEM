# BMI_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
The BMI Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP and MySQL to help users calculate, store, and manage their Body Mass Index (BMI) records. The system allows users to register, log in securely, calculate their BMI using height and weight, and maintain a personal BMI history over time.
BMI Management System – Project Description

The application implements core PHP and MySQL concepts, including database connection, CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), user authentication, cookies, and sessions. A secure dashboard (control panel) is provided where authenticated users can manage their BMI records, view health tips based on BMI results, and update their profile information.

The system uses sessions to track logged-in users and control access to protected pages, and it includes an automatic session expiration feature to enhance security. All data displayed in the application is retrieved dynamically from the MySQL database.

The BMI Management System follows good programming practices with proper validation, structured code, and a clean user interface, making it suitable for academic projects and real-world learning of web application development using PHP and MySQL.
